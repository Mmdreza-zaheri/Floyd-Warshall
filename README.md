# Floyd-Warshall
**Shortest Paths Visualization and Calculation**

This Python script is designed to visualize and compute shortest paths in a directed graph using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. It utilizes various libraries such as Matplotlib, NumPy, and NetworkX to achieve this functionality. The code offers a graphical representation of the graph's nodes and edges, along with their corresponding weights, using a Tkinter-based GUI window.

**Features:**
- Dynamically constructs a directed graph based on user inputs for nodes, edges, and edge weights.
- Implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
- Renders the graph and its shortest paths using Matplotlib and NetworkX, presented within a Tkinter GUI window.
- Displays node labels, edge weights, and computed shortest paths for user-friendly visualization.

**Instructions:**
1. Run the script and provide the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
2. Input node labels and edge details as prompted.
3. The script then calculates the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
4. A graphical representation of the graph, including nodes, edges, and their weights, will be displayed in a Tkinter window.
5. The computed shortest paths are shown in the GUI alongside the visual representation.

**Dependencies:**
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations.
- NumPy: A library for numerical computations in Python.
- NetworkX: A library for creating, analyzing, and visualizing complex networks.
- Tkinter: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library.

Feel free to use and modify this code for educational purposes, graph analysis, or algorithm demonstrations.
